## Info

This is a project which I started with a friend of mine. We both wanted to learn Godot as we never used that engine and we decided to challenge ourself during this project by also using
a lot of other new software and skills.
### New Software Learned
- **Godot:**  The game is being made in Godot.
- **Sonic Pi:** Right now all sound effects are made using Sonic Pi.
- **Aseprite:** Me and my friend took out our best artistic skills to make pixel art for this game.
